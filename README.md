# OpenCL based FPGA Accelerator for CNNs 

## About
We designed a Neural Network Accelerator for [Darknet Reference Model](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/imagenet/#reference) (which  is 2.9 times faster than AlexNet and attains the same top-1 and top-5 performance as AlexNet but with 1/10th the parameters).
